Code Warriors - Project 4 - Swap 'n Break

Swap 'n Break is a Bejeweled-style game written in Java. It is meant to be used as a simple way to kill time or relax and find color patterns effectively.

To run it, import the project into Eclipse and run it as a Java Application. For the sake of time, a exported class file has not been made, so this is the only way to run the code.
